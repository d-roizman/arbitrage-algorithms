# Pairs trading algorithm
This repository contains an algorithm that searches for EV-EBITDA multiple disparities among a list of stocks. Shortly, it obtains daily EV-EBITDA data for the past 3 months for every stock on your list. Then it tests for cointegration between EV-EBITDA series each pair of correlated stocks. Finally, it checks if today's ratio of the EV-EBITDA series of these (correlated) stocks is significantly above (or below) it's 3 months average.
